# Architecture

Tirea runtime is organized as three layers:

```text
Application -> AgentOs (orchestration + execution engine) -> Thread/State Engine
```

## 1. Application Layer

Your application defines tools, agent definitions, and integration endpoints.

Primary call path:

- Build `AgentOs` via `AgentOsBuilder`
- Submit `RunRequest`
- Consume streamed `AgentEvent`

## 2. AgentOs (Orchestration + Execution)

`AgentOs` handles both pre-run orchestration and loop execution:

**Orchestration** (`composition/`, `runtime/`):
- Resolve agent/model/plugin wiring (plugins implement the `AgentBehavior` trait)
- Load or create thread
- Deduplicate incoming messages
- Persist pre-run checkpoint
- Construct `RunContext`

**Execution engine** (`engine/`, `runtime/loop_runner/`):

Loop is phase-driven:

- `RunStart`
- `StepStart -> BeforeInference -> AfterInference -> BeforeToolExecute -> AfterToolExecute -> StepEnd`
- `RunEnd`

Termination is explicit in `RunFinish.termination`.

## 3. Thread + State Engine

State mutation is patch-based:

- `State' = apply_patch(State, Patch)`
- `Thread` stores base state + patch history + messages
- `RunContext` accumulates run delta and emits `take_delta()` for persistence

## Design Intent

- Deterministic state transitions
- Append-style persistence with version checks
- Transport-independent runtime (`AgentEvent` as core stream)
